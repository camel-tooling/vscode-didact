= Accessing Commands in Visual Studio Code

Though Visual Studio Code is, at heart, a code editor, it employs a command API under the covers that does everything from opening views and files to creating and manipulating integrated terminals. It's an amazingly powerful framework and it's available at your fingertips!

How do you access this amazing functionality? The Command Palette!

== Accessing the Command Palette

The most important key combination to know is `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `F1` on some platforms), which brings up the Command Palette. From here, you have access to all of the functionality of VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.

Type `?` into the input field to get a list of available commands you can execute from here:

Each VS Code extension you install in your local workbench potentially adds more commands for you to leverage to complete day to day tasks, and you can assign them Keyboard Shortcuts using the Keyboard Shortcuts editor available via the `File -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts` menu. link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings[See the Visual Studio Docs for more details]!
