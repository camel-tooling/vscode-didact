See the [VSCode Didact readme about link formatting for more information](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-didact/blob/main/README.md)!",

To find an ID, go to `File->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts`, find the command in the list, then right-click and select `Copy Command ID` to get its ID. ",
        "* Commands then have various parameters you can pass them. You may have to do some research to discover what parameters to pass, but for the `vscode.didact.sendNamedTerminalAsString` command, you simply need to pass the name for the terminal and the string to execute at the terminal prompt. In this case, we are going to call our terminal `NewTerminal` and execute `echo We just called echo!`. Strings must be URI encoded, so spaces must be `%20` and so on.",
